# Volvox Brand Guidelines

## Company Overview

**Volvox LLC** — Wyoming-based software company (est. January 2020 by Bill Chirico) that builds practical software solving real-life challenges, including mobile apps and SaaS products.

**Volvox Community** — A no-gatekeeping developer learning community (est. 2018) that teaches through open source software. The community predates the company and remains central to everything we do.

The name comes from _Volvox_, colonial green algae where cells work together as a unified organism—mirroring our philosophy of developers collaborating and apps connecting people.

## Brand Identity

### Core Values

1. **No Gatekeeping** — Knowledge shared freely through real production software, not tutorial projects.
2. **Practical Solutions** — Every product addresses genuine pain points.
3. **Community First** — Volvox Community drives learning; Volvox LLC builds the products.
4. **Accountability** — Our apps help people stay accountable to themselves and others.

### Visual Identity

**Colors:**

| Color            | Hex       | Usage                            |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Primary Blue     | `#007AFF` | Logo, buttons, headers, links    |
| Secondary Purple | `#AF58DA` | Accents, gradients               |
| Accent Orange    | `#FF9500` | CTAs, highlights (use sparingly) |
| Dark             | `#1C1C1E` | Text, dark backgrounds           |
| Light            | `#F2F2F7` | Light backgrounds, borders       |

**Typography:** JetBrains Mono (Regular 400, Medium 500, Bold 700)

**Logo Files:**

- `circle.png` — Social profiles, app icons
- `banner4096x2304.jpg` — YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter headers

### Voice & Tone

**Professional humor—credible with personality.**

We write like we talk: direct, helpful, occasionally funny. Never punch down, never gatekeep, never make users feel stupid.

| Situation         | Tone                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Marketing         | Confident, inviting    |
| Errors            | Helpful, light         |
| Docs              | Clear, encouraging     |
| Recovery features | Empathetic, respectful |

**Principles:** Be direct. Be human. Be helpful. Be inclusive. Be consistent.

**Humor:** Self-deprecating about our dev struggles is fine. Never joke about serious topics (addiction, recovery, mental health). Keep it natural—don't force it.
