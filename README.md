# Volvox Brand Guidelines

## Company Overview

**Volvox LLC** is a Wyoming-based software development company founded on January 2, 2020. We operate with a dual mission: building practical mobile apps that solve real-life challenges and fostering a no-gatekeeping developer learning community.

### Why "Volvox"?

The name comes from _Volvox_, a genus of colonial green algae where individual cells work together as a unified organism. This mirrors our philosophy—individual developers collaborating to build something greater than themselves, and apps that connect people to support one another.

## Brand Identity

### Core Values

1. **No Gatekeeping** — Knowledge should be shared freely. We build real production software, not tutorial projects.
2. **Practical Solutions** — Every product addresses genuine pain points, not hypothetical problems.
3. **Community First** — The learning community predates the LLC (est. 2018) and remains central to everything we do.
4. **Accountability** — Our apps help people stay accountable to themselves and others.

### Brand Personality

We're the friend who happens to be a developer—someone who explains complex concepts without condescension, cracks jokes without forcing them, and genuinely wants to see you succeed.

**Key traits:**

- Witty but not sarcastic
- Professional but not corporate
- Approachable but credible
- Helpful but not preachy

## Visual Identity

### Logo

The Volvox logo represents the colonial nature of our namesake organism—interconnected cells forming a greater whole. The organic, blob-like shapes symbolize growth, connection, and fluid movement.

**Logo Variants:**
| Variant | Use Case | File |
|---------|----------|------|
| Primary | General use, websites, documents | `logo.png` |
| Circle | Social media profiles, app icons | `circle.png` |
| Banner | YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter headers | `banner4096x2304.jpg` |

**Logo Specifications:**

- Minimum clear space: Equal to the height of the smallest circle element
- Minimum size: 32px for digital, 0.5" for print
- Never distort, rotate, or alter the logo proportions

### Color Palette

| Color                | Hex       | RGB                  | Usage                                  |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Blue**     | `#007AFF` | `rgb(0, 122, 255)`   | Logo, primary buttons, headers, links  |
| **Secondary Purple** | `#AF58DA` | `rgb(175, 88, 218)`  | Accents, gradients, secondary elements |
| **Accent Orange**    | `#FF9500` | `rgb(255, 149, 0)`   | CTAs, highlights, warnings, badges     |
| **White**            | `#FFFFFF` | `rgb(255, 255, 255)` | Backgrounds, logo on dark              |
| **Dark Gray**        | `#1C1C1E` | `rgb(28, 28, 30)`    | Text, dark mode backgrounds            |
| **Light Gray**       | `#F2F2F7` | `rgb(242, 242, 247)` | Light backgrounds, borders             |

**Color Usage Guidelines:**

- Primary Blue is the dominant brand color—use it for the majority of branded elements
- Secondary Purple adds depth and is ideal for gradients when paired with Primary Blue
- Accent Orange is for attention-grabbing elements only—use sparingly
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

| Weight        | Usage                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Regular (400) | Body text, descriptions  |
| Medium (500)  | Subheadings, emphasis    |
| Bold (700)    | Headlines, buttons, CTAs |

**Font Pairing Recommendations:**

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

**Witty, professional humor—approachable yet credible.**

We write like we talk: direct, helpful, and occasionally funny. We never punch down, never gatekeep, and never make users feel stupid for not knowing something.

### Tone Guidelines

| Situation                   | Tone                   | Example                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marketing copy              | Confident, inviting    | "Track your progress. Celebrate your wins. Keep going."          |
| Error messages              | Helpful, light         | "Oops, that didn't work. Let's try again."                       |
| Documentation               | Clear, encouraging     | "Here's how to set up your first jar—it takes about 30 seconds." |
| Community posts             | Friendly, supportive   | "Great question! Here's what's happening under the hood..."      |
| Serious features (recovery) | Empathetic, respectful | "Your journey matters. We're here to help you stay on track."    |

### Writing Principles

1. **Be direct** — Say what you mean. Avoid corporate jargon.
2. **Be human** — Write like a person, not a brand.
3. **Be helpful** — Every piece of content should serve the reader.
4. **Be inclusive** — Use language that welcomes everyone.
5. **Be consistent** — Same voice across all touchpoints.

### Words We Use

| Instead of... | We say...     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Leverage      | Use           |
| Utilize       | Use           |
| Synergy       | Collaboration |
| Disrupt       | Improve       |
| Revolutionary | Helpful       |
| Best-in-class | Great         |

### Humor Guidelines

- ✅ Self-deprecating humor about our own struggles as developers
- ✅ Light wordplay and puns (in moderation)
- ✅ Pop culture references that are broadly accessible
- ❌ Jokes at users' expense
- ❌ Humor about serious topics (addiction, recovery, mental health)
- ❌ Forced or excessive jokes—one per piece is usually enough
